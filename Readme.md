# Rat in the Maze Simulator
  
## Introduction

Welcome to the Rat in the Maze Simulator! This web project aims to provide a visual representation of the famous rat in the maze problem from the field of Data Structures and Algorithms. The simulation showcases each step that the rat takes, including backtracking, in order to find the path to the exit of the maze. It serves as a useful tool to understand and learn the concepts of maze traversal algorithms.

## Features
### Real-time Simulation: 
The simulator displays each step taken by the rat in real-time, providing a visual representation of the maze traversal process.
### Backtracking:
Witness the rat's ability to backtrack and explore different paths in order to find the optimal route to the maze exit.
### Multiple Maze Configurations: 
Choose from a variety of maze configurations to challenge the rat and explore the different maze solving strategies.
### Step-by-Step Explanation: 
The simulator provides step-by-step explanations of the algorithms used, helping users understand the underlying concepts of maze traversal.
