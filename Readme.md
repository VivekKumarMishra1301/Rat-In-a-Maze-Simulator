# Rat in the Maze Simulator
  
## Introduction

Welcome to the Rat in the Maze Simulator! This web project aims to provide a visual representation of the famous rat in the maze problem from the field of Data Structures and Algorithms. The simulation showcases each step that the rat takes, including backtracking, in order to find the path to the exit of the maze. It serves as a useful tool to understand and learn the concepts of maze traversal algorithms.

## Features
### Real-time Simulation: 
The simulator displays each step taken by the rat in real-time, providing a visual representation of the maze traversal process.
### Backtracking:
Witness the rat's ability to backtrack and explore different paths in order to find the optimal route to the maze exit.
### Multiple Maze Configurations: 
Choose from a variety of maze configurations to challenge the rat and explore the different maze solving strategies.
### Step-by-Step Explanation: 
The simulator provides step-by-step explanations of the algorithms used, helping users understand the underlying concepts of maze traversal.

## User guide

Here's a step-by-step processfor initial setup and usage of Rat in the Maze Simulator:

Open the Rat in the Maze Simulator:
Navigate to the web application of the Rat in the Maze Simulator by accessing the provided URL.

Specify the Maze Size: 
Upon opening the simulator, you will be presented with an input box to specify the size of the maze. Enter the desired size, indicating the number of rows and columns, and ensure that the input values are valid (e.g., positive integers).

Create the Maze: 
After specifying the maze size, click on the "Create Maze" button. The simulator will generate a maze based on the provided dimensions, and all cells will initially appear green, indicating a clear path.

Add Hindrances: 
To add hindrances or obstacles to the maze, simply click on any desired cell(s). Upon clicking, the respective cell(s) will turn red, indicating a blocked path. This feature allows you to customize the maze layout by adding obstacles for the rat to navigate around.

Start the Simulation: 
Once you have set up the maze and added hindrances, click on the "Start" button to begin the simulation. The rat will start exploring the maze from the starting point and proceed towards finding the exit.

Observe the Rat's Movements: 
During the simulation, the rat's movements will be visually displayed in real-time. You can observe each step it takes, including any backtracking, as it tries to find the optimal path to the maze's exit. The simulator will update the visualization with each move the rat makes.

Pause and Resume the Simulation: 
If you wish to pause the simulation at any point, click on the "Pause" button. This will temporarily halt the rat's movements, allowing you to analyze the current state of the maze. To resume the simulation, click on the "Resume" button.

Navigate through Simulation Steps: 
You can navigate through the simulation steps by using the provided controls, such as "Next Step" and "Previous Step" buttons. This allows you to manually step through the rat's movements and examine each stage of its path-finding process.

Reset the Simulation: 
To start over or try a new configuration, click on the "Reset" button. This will clear the current maze and any hindrances added, allowing you to create a new maze or modify the existing one.
